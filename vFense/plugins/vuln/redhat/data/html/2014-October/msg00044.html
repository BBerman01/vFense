                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Important: openstack-keystone security and bug fix update
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2014:1688-01
Product:           Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform
Advisory URL:      <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1688.html">https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1688.html</a>
Issue date:        2014-10-22
CVE Names:         CVE-2014-2828 CVE-2014-3621 
=====================================================================

1. Summary:

Updated openstack-keystone packages that fix two security issues and
multiple bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack
Platform 4.0.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0 - noarch

3. Description:

The OpenStack Identity service (keystone) authenticates and authorizes
OpenStack users by keeping track of users and their permitted activities.
The Identity service supports multiple forms of authentication, including
user name and password credentials, token-based systems, and AWS-style
logins.

A flaw was found in the keystone V3 API. An attacker could send a single
request with the same authentication method multiple times, possibly
leading to a denial of service due to generating excessive load with
minimal requests. Only keystone setups with the V3 API enabled were
affected by this issue. (CVE-2014-2828)

A flaw was found in the keystone catalog URL replacement. A user with
permissions to register an endpoint could use this flaw to leak
configuration data, including the master admin_token. Only keystone setups
that allow non-cloud-admin users to create endpoints were affected by this
issue. (CVE-2014-3621)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting
CVE-2014-3621. Upstream acknowledges Brant Knudson from IBM as the original
reporter of this issue.

The openstack-keystone packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2013.2.4, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.
(BZ#1146083)

This update fixes the following bugs:

* When using an LDAP back end, the Identity service failed with a 'Bad
search filter' error whenever a token request was made for a user whose ID
contained a comma (for example, 'Doe, John'). However, if the user's ID
contained no comma ('John Doe'), the Identity service grants token requests
as expected. This was because the LDAP back end code of the Identity server
did not properly escape special characters when creating search filters.
This update adds the necessary escaping, thereby allowing the Identity
server to perform LDAP search operations correctly. (BZ#1099628)

* Previously, if the Identity service encountered a failed connection to a
message broker, re-connection attempts kept failing as well. This was
because the Identity service tried to reconnect to the same failing message
broker, even if there were multiple hosts configured. This has been fixed
by making the reconnect() implementation select the next broker in the
list. As a result, when multiple broker hosts are provided, the Identity
service will try the next one in the list at every connection attempt.
This means that non-failure reconnect attempts will also switch from the
current broker to the next in the list. Hence, users should not rely on any
particular order when using brokers from the list. (BZ#1082669)

* The Identity service now logs successful authentications of users.
In previous releases, only authentication failures were logged.
(BZ#1098635)

* When using the LDAP back end and connecting to Active Directory
anonymously, trying to use the top-level suffix as the user_tree_dn (or
tenant/role_tree_dn) failed with a communication error. This is because the
Identity service attempted to chase returned referrals, which is not
allowed by default in Active Directory for security reasons. This update
adds a new configuration option to disable referral chasing for LDAP search
operations, namely chase_referrals. When this option is disabled, the
Identity service will skip over any returned referrals without chasing
them. (BZ#1093833)

All openstack-keystone users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues.
