=====================================================================
                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Moderate: openstack-nova security, bug fix, and enhancement update
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2014:0578-01
Product:           Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform
Advisory URL:      <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0578.html">https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0578.html</a>
Issue date:        2014-05-29
CVE Names:         CVE-2014-0134 
=====================================================================

1. Summary:

Updated openstack-nova packages that fix one security issue, several bugs,
and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
OpenStack Platform 4.0.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0 - noarch

3. Description:

OpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual
machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform.
Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to
orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances, managing
networks, and controlling access through users and projects.

It was found that overwriting the disk inside of an instance with a
malicious image, and then switching the instance to rescue mode, could
potentially allow an authenticated user to access arbitrary files on the
compute host depending on the file permissions and SELinux constraints of
those files. Only setups that used libvirt to spawn instances and which had
the use of cow images disabled (&quot;use_cow_images = False&quot; in nova
configuration) were affected. (CVE-2014-0134)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack Project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Stanislaw Pitucha from Hewlett Packard as the
original reporter.

Bug fixes:

* The Compute libguestfs did not perform tear down correctly in certain
cases, such as when attempting to perform SSH key injection when no SSH
keys were specified. As a result, libguestfs qemu instances would remain
running, even after the Compute instance with which they were associated
was destroyed. This has been fixed and now tear down of libguestfs occurs
correctly. (BZ#1022627)

* Qpid's driver reconnection delay is not configurable. This and the fact
that the hard-coded delay was quite high became a blocker issue from an HA
perspective. Making this value configurable is not possible for this
version, so the hard-coded delay was changed. The new delay cap is 5
seconds. (BZ#1060772)

* Nova was creating a temporary VMware snapshot during a nova snapshot, but
not deleting it on completion. Thus VMware guests could end up with a large
number of unnecessary snapshots. The temporary VMware snapshot is now
deleted on completion of the nova snapshot operation. (BZ#1069429)

* The Nova vmware driver was not passing the iscsi server location to the
instance, hence it was not possible to add a cinder iscsi disk to a VMware
instance. The nova vmware driver now correctly passes the iscsi server
location to the instance and it is possible to add a cinder iscsi disk to a
VMware instance. (BZ#1069432)

* The nova VMware driver was assigning VNC ports in a way which could cause
collisions between guests. There was a small chance that 2 instances could
be created with the same VNC port. If both instances ran on the same ESX
host, only one of their consoles would be available. However, that console
would be presented when requested for both instances. This has been fixed
so that the nova VMware driver now allocates VNC ports which are unique to
a vcenter, and a user of one instance will not be presented with the
console of another. (BZ#1077017)

Enhancement:

* When troubleshooting production systems it is desirable to be able to
trace all data base queries, web REST calls, messaging service RPC calls,
and libvirt API calls associated with invocation of a user command or
background job. Hence, the ability has been added to obtain a debug dump of
the system state for an OpenStack service based process. For example, upon
sending SIGUSR1, a dump of all native threads, green threads, live
configuration, and any other relevant info is triggered. (BZ#1071469)

All openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which correct these issues and add this enhancement.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

5. Bugs fixed (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/</a>):

1060772 - nova qpid reconnection delay must be more accurate
1069429 - VMware: delete vm snapshot after nova snapshot
1069432 - VMware: iscsi target discovery fails while attaching volumes
