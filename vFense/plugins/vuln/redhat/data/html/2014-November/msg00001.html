                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Important: openstack-nova security, bug fix, and enhancement update
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2014:1782-01
Product:           Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform
Advisory URL:      <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1782.html">https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1782.html</a>
Issue date:        2014-11-03
CVE Names:         CVE-2014-3608 CVE-2014-8750 
=====================================================================

1. Summary:

Updated openstack-nova packages that fix two security issues, multiple
bugs, and add enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for RHEL 7 - noarch

3. Description:

OpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual
machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform.
Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to
orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances, managing
networks, and controlling access through users and projects.

A race condition flaw was found in the way the nova VMware driver handled
VNC port allocation. An authenticated user could use this flaw to gain
unauthorized console access to instances belonging to other tenants by
repeatedly spawning new instances. Note that only nova setups using the
VMware driver and the VNC proxy service were affected. (CVE-2014-8750)

CVE-2014-2573, the fix for which was provided with the initial release of
Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 7, describes a flaw in the nova VMware driver. An authenticated user
could exceed their quota by placing an image into rescue and then deleting
it, causing the rescue image to be left behind.

It was found that the fix for CVE-2014-2573 was incomplete. A virtual
machine could be forced into the ERROR state from rescue by issuing a
suspend command. Virtual machines deleted from the ERROR state would still
leave the rescue image behind, allowing a user to exceed their quota. Note
that only setups using the nova VMware driver were affected.
(CVE-2014-3608)

The CVE-2014-3608 issue was discovered by Garth Mollett of Red Hat Product
Security.

The openstack-nova packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2014.1.3, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
previous version. (BZ#1149737)

This update also fixes the following bug:

* Previously, unhandled database deadlock conditions triggered with some
database configuration edge cases. &quot;Deadlock found when trying to get lock;
try restarting transaction&quot; messages may have been logged, and database
transactions may have been lost. With this update, actions are retried on
deadlock conditions, resulting in robust database communication.
(BZ#1141972)

All openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which correct these issues and add these enhancements.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.
