Compression and decompression run faster than realtime\n on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the\n ETSI standard test patterns.",

This implies that the\n default version will be part of the package distribution, and must\n not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at\n any other time).\n .\n This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that\n may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,\n but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to\n maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general\n offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally\n provides for 'conffiles'.\n .\n Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a\n file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come\n under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at\n installation time.
