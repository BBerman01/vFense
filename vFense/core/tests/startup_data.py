It stays compatible with the Python database\n API specification 2.0 as much as possible, but also exposes most\n of SQLite's native API, so that it is for example possible to\n create user-defined SQL functions and aggregates in Python.\n .\n If you need a relational database for your applications, or even\n small tools or helper scripts, pysqlite is often a good fit. It's\n easy to use, easy to deploy, and does not depend on any other\n Python libraries or platform libraries, except SQLite.

        "description": "Access much of the Toshiba laptop hardware interface\n Toshset is a command-line tool to allow access to much of the\n Toshiba laptop hardware interface developed by Jonathan Buzzard. It can do\n things like set the hard drive spin-down time, turn off the display\n and set the fan speed without the help of the kernel.\n Toshset requires an experimental version of the toshiba_acpi kernel module\n with an ACPI-enabled kernel. Otherwise it works only if the laptop supports\n the old APM BIOS. (The last of these was produced something like 5 years ago)\n Please read README.Debian how to install the experimental version of the\n toshiba_acpi kernel module. (Ubuntu users don't need it)\n .\n This package also includes the Toshsat1800-irdasetup by Daniele Peri.  It\n can be used to configure IrDA for laptops with ALI1533 bridge (LPC47N227\n SuperIO), smc-ircc and not initializing BIOS (tested on Toshiba Satellite\n 1800-514).

The easy way to achieve this behavior\n is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg\n handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as\n needed.\n .\n This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default\n version that will work for most installations, although some system\n administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the\n default version will be part of the package distribution, and must\n not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at\n any other time).\n .\n This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that\n may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,\n but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to\n maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general\n offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally\n provides for 'conffiles'.\n .\n Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a\n file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come\n under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at\n installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the\n one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to\n conffile status.",
