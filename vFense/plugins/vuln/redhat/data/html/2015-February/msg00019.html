=====================================================================

1. Summary:

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.5.0 is now available.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

RHEV-M 3.5 - noarch

3. Description:

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is a visual tool for centrally
managing collections of virtual servers running Red Hat Enterprise Linux
and Microsoft Windows. This package also includes the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Manager API, a set of scriptable commands that give
administrators the ability to perform queries and operations on Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

The Manager is a JBoss Application Server application that provides several
interfaces through which the virtual environment can be accessed and
interacted with, including an Administration Portal, a User Portal, and a
Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface
(API).

It was discovered that the HttpClient incorrectly extracted the host name
from an X.509 certificate subject's Common Name (CN) field.
A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server
using a specially crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2012-6153, CVE-2014-3577)

A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) flaw was found in the oVirt REST API.
A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted web page that, when
visited by a user with a valid REST API session, would allow the attacker
to trigger calls to the oVirt REST API. (CVE-2014-0151)

It was found that the oVirt web admin interface did not include the
HttpOnly flag when setting session IDs with the Set-Cookie header.
This flaw could make it is easier for a remote attacker to hijack an oVirt
web admin session by leveraging a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
(CVE-2014-0154)

The CVE-2012-6153 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat
Product Security.

These updated Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager packages also
include numerous bug fixes and various enhancements. Space precludes
documenting all of these changes in this advisory. Users are directed to
the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.5 Manager Release Notes document,
linked to in the References, for information on the most significant of
these changes.

All Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager users are advised to upgrade
to these updated packages, which resolve these issues and add these
enhancements.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.
