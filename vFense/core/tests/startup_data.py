Security-enhanced\n Linux is a patch of the Linux kernel and a number of utilities with\n enhanced security functionality designed to add mandatory access\n controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux kernel contains new\n architectural components originally developed to improve the security\n of the Flask operating system. These architectural components provide\n general support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access\n control policies, including those based on the concepts of Type\n Enforcement, Role-based Access Control, and Multi-level Security.\n .\n libselinux1 provides an API for SELinux applications to get and set\n process and file security contexts and to obtain security policy\n decisions.  Required for any applications that use the SELinux\n API. libselinux may use the shared libsepol to manipulate the binary\n policy if necessary (e.g. to downgrade the policy format to an older\n version supported by the kernel) when loading policy.",

This implies that the\n default version will be part of the package distribution, and must\n not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at\n any other time).\n .\n This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that\n may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,\n but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to\n maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general\n offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally\n provides for 'conffiles'.\n .\n Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a\n file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come\n under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at\n installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the\n one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to\n conffile status.",
