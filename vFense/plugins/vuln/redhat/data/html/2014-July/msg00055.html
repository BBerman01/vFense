=====================================================================
                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Moderate: openstack-nova security and bug fix update
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2014:0940-01
Product:           Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform
Advisory URL:      <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0940.html">https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0940.html</a>
Issue date:        2014-07-24
CVE Names:         CVE-2014-3517 
=====================================================================

1. Summary:

Updated openstack-nova packages that fix one security issue and several
bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0
(Icehouse) for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

OpenStack 5.0 for RHEL 7 - noarch

3. Description:

OpenStack Compute (Nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual
machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform.

A side-channel timing attack flaw was found in Nova. An attacker could
possibly use this flaw to guess valid instance ID signatures, giving them
access to details of another instance, by analyzing the response times of
requests for instance metadata. This issue only affected configurations
that proxy metadata requests via Neutron. (CVE-2014-3517)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Alex Gaynor from Rackspace as the original reporter.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* The GlusterFS driver changes the file name used to point to a volume when
a snapshot is changed, but in the past the new file name was not stored in
Compute's block device information.

As a result, if the VM was shut down and started again, the old file name
in the snapshot chain was used, resulting in corruption of the qcow2 chain
and unexpected results in the instance.

This has been fixed by persisting the new file name in Compute's block
device info when a snapshot is created. Now, GlusterFS volumes work as
expected after creating or deleting a snapshot and then rebooting the
instance. (BZ#1085852)

* Previously, in some cases, it may not have been possible to attach a
read-only volume to an instance. (BZ#1100358)

* The sysfsutils package enables the Compute service to attach Block
Storage volumes. This package is automatically installed by PackStack.
However, sysfsutils was not a dependency of the Compute service; as such,
when not using PackStack, it was possible to deploy OpenStack without
sysfsutils installed. When this occurred, the Compute service was unable to
attach Block Storage volumes.

With this release, the sysfsutils package is now a dependency of the
Compute service. This ensures that sysfsutils is installed, regardless of
what deployment method is used. (BZ#1114637)

* An issue with Fibre Channel Cinder volumes not being removed after the
image has been destroyed has been fixed. (BZ#1115375)

* This update fixes legacy group support, allowing you to provide a group
by name in the scheduler hint instead of using the new server groups API.
(BZ#1116866)

* The openstack-nova package has been updated to upstream version
2014.1.1, which fixes a number of bugs. (BZ#1117895)

All openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which correct these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to

5. Bugs fixed (<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/</a>):

1085852 - GlusterFS: Instance is not using the correct snapshot backing file after reboot
1100358 - can't attach a read only volume to an instance
1112499 - CVE-2014-3517 openstack-nova: timing attack issue allows access to other instances' configuration information
1114637 - sysfsutils needs to be a dependency of OpenStack nova
1115375 - FC cinder volumes still show mpath device on nova host after volumes are detached from instance.
1116866 - Fix legacy server group support
1117895 - Rebase openstack-nova to 2014.1.1
