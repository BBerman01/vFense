=====================================================================

1. Summary:

Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works 6.0.0 roll up patch 3, which fixes
multiple security issues and various bugs, is now available from the Red
Hat Customer Portal.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

2. Description:

Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works is the next-generation ESB and business
process automation infrastructure.

This roll up patch serves as a cumulative upgrade for Red Hat JBoss Fuse
Service Works 6.0.0. It includes various bug fixes, which are listed in the
README file included with the patch files.

The following security issues are fixed with this release:

It was found that the secure processing feature of Xalan-Java had
insufficient restrictions defined for certain properties and features.
A remote attacker able to provide Extensible Stylesheet Language
Transformations (XSLT) content to be processed by an application using
Xalan-Java could use this flaw to bypass the intended constraints of the
secure processing feature. Depending on the components available in the
classpath, this could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the
context of the application server running the application that uses
Xalan-Java. (CVE-2014-0107)

It was found that the ParserPool and Decrypter classes in the OpenSAML Java
implementation resolved external entities, permitting XML External Entity
(XXE) attacks. A remote attacker could use this flaw to read files
accessible to the user running the application server, and potentially
perform other more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2013-6440)

It was found that Java Security Manager permissions configured via a policy
file were not properly applied, causing all deployed applications to be
granted the java.security.AllPermission permission. In certain cases, an
attacker could use this flaw to circumvent expected security measures to
perform actions which would otherwise be restricted. (CVE-2014-0093)

The HawtJNI Library class wrote native libraries to a predictable file name
in /tmp/ when the native libraries were bundled in a JAR file, and no
custom library path was specified. A local attacker could overwrite these
native libraries with malicious versions during the window between when
HawtJNI writes them and when they are executed. (CVE-2013-2035)

In Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, when running under a
security manager, it was possible for deployed code to get access to the
Modular Service Container (MSC) service registry without any permission
checks. This could allow malicious deployments to modify the internal state
of the server in various ways. (CVE-2014-0018)

It was found that the security audit functionality logged request
parameters in plain text. This may have caused passwords to be included in
the audit log files when using BASIC or FORM-based authentication. A local
attacker with access to audit log files could possibly use this flaw to
obtain application or server authentication credentials. (CVE-2014-0058)

The CVE-2013-6440 issue was discovered by David Illsley, Ron Gutierrez of
Gotham Digital Science, and David Jorm of Red Hat Product Security; the
CVE-2014-0093 issue was discovered by Josef Cacek of the Red Hat JBoss EAP
Quality Engineering team; the CVE-2013-2035 issue was discovered by Florian
Weimer of Red Hat Product Security; and the CVE-2014-0018 issue was
discovered by Stuart Douglas of Red Hat.

All users of Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works 6.0.0 as provided from the
Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this roll up patch.

3. Solution:

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying the update, back up your
existing Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works installation (including its
databases, applications, configuration files, and so on).

Note that it is recommended to halt the Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works
server by stopping the JBoss Application Server process before installing
this update, and then after installing the update, restart the Red Hat
JBoss Fuse Service Works server by starting the JBoss Application
Server process.
