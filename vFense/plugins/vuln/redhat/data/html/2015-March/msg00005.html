=====================================================================
                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Low: docker security, bug fix, and enhancement update
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2015:0623-02
Product:           RHEL Extras
Advisory URL:      <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-0623.html">https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-0623.html</a>
Issue date:        2015-03-05
CVE Names:         CVE-2014-9356 CVE-2014-9357 
=====================================================================

1. Summary:

Updated docker packages that fix two security issues, several bugs, and add
various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
Extras.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras - noarch, x86_64

3. Description:

Docker is a service providing container management on Linux.

It was found that a malicious container image could overwrite arbitrary
portions of the host file system by including absolute symlinks,
potentially leading to privilege escalation. (CVE-2014-9356)

A flaw was found in the way the Docker service unpacked images or builds
after a &quot;docker pull&quot;. An attacker could use this flaw to provide a
malicious image or build that, when unpacked, would escalate their
privileges on the system. (CVE-2014-9357)

Red Hat would like to thank Docker Inc. for reporting these issues.

The docker-python subpackage provides the new Atomic tool. The goal of
Atomic is to provide a high level, coherent entry point for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux Atomic Host. Atomic makes it easier to interact with
special kinds of containers, such as super-privileged debugging tools.
Comprehensive information and documentation is available in the atomic
manual pages.

The docker packages have been upgraded to upstream version 1.4.1, which
provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version,
most notably an experimental overlayfs storage driver. (BZ#1174351)

Bug fixes:

* The JSON configuration files for containers and images were inconsistent.
As a consequence, when these files were parsed by the &quot;docker inspect&quot;
command, the output was unnecessarily complex. This update improves the key
naming schema in the configuration files and the output from &quot;docker
inspect&quot; is now uniform. (BZ#1092773)

* The /run directory had an incorrect SELinux label. As a consequence,
containers could not access /run. This update corrects the SELinux label
and containers now have access to /run. (BZ#1100009)

* The Docker service contained an incorrect path for the secrets directory.
As a consequence, executing &quot;docker run&quot; failed to create containers. This
update fixes the default path to the secrets directory and &quot;docker run&quot; now
executes successfully. (BZ#1102568)

* It was not possible to specify a default repository in the configuration
file in cases where all docker.io files are inaccessible. As a consequence,
running docker commands failed because they could not contact the default
repositories. Now, it is possible to specify a local Docker repository, and
commands no longer fail because they are able to connect to a local private
repository. (BZ#1106430)

* When executing the &quot;docker attach&quot; command on a container which was in
the process of shutting down, the process did not fail, but became
unresponsive. This bug has been fixed, and running &quot;docker attach&quot; on a
container which is shutting down causes the attach process to fail with an
informative error message that it is not possible to attach to a stopped
container. (BZ#1113608)

* The &quot;docker run&quot; sub-command incorrectly returned non-zero exit codes,
when they all should have been zero. As a consequence, it was not possible
to differentiate between the exit codes of the docker command line and exit
codes of contained processes, which in turn made automated control of
&quot;docker run&quot; impossible. This update fixes the inconsistencies within the
exit codes of &quot;docker run&quot;. Additionally, this update also fixes
inconsistencies of other docker sub-commands and improves the language in
the error and warning messages. (BZ#1162807)

* Adding a new registry with the &quot;--registry-prepend&quot; option did not follow
the correct order to query and download an image. As a consequence, it did
not query the prepended new registry first, but rather started with
querying docker.io. The &quot;--registry-prepend&quot; option has been renamed to
&quot;--registry-add&quot; and its behavior has been changed to query the registries
added in the given order, with docker.io queried last. (BZ#1186153)

All docker users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
correct these issues and add these enhancements.
