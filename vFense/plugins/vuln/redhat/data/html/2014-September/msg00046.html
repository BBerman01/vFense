=====================================================================

1. Summary:

Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.0.3, which fixes multiple security issues,
several bugs, and adds various enhancements, is now available from the Red
Hat Customer Portal.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

2. Description:

Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite is a business rules and processes management system
for the management, storage, creation, modification, and deployment of
JBoss rules and BPMN2-compliant business processes.

This release of Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.0.3 serves as a replacement for
Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.0.2, and includes bug fixes and enhancements.
Refer to the Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.0.3 Release Notes for information on
the most significant of these changes. The Release Notes are available at
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_BPM_Suite/">https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_BPM_Suite/</a>

The following security issues are fixed with this release:

It was found that the secure processing feature of Xalan-Java had
insufficient restrictions defined for certain properties and features.
A remote attacker able to provide Extensible Stylesheet Language
Transformations (XSLT) content to be processed by an application using
Xalan-Java could use this flaw to bypass the intended constraints of the
secure processing feature. Depending on the components available in the
classpath, this could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the
context of the application server running the application that uses
Xalan-Java. (CVE-2014-0107)

It was found that the ParserPool and Decrypter classes in the OpenSAML
Java implementation resolved external entities, permitting XML External
Entity (XXE) attacks. A remote attacker could use this flaw to read files
accessible to the user running the application server, and potentially
perform other more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2013-6440)

It was found that Java Security Manager permissions configured via a policy
file were not properly applied, causing all deployed applications to be
granted the java.security.AllPermission permission. In certain cases, an
attacker could use this flaw to circumvent expected security measures to
perform actions which would otherwise be restricted. (CVE-2014-0093)

The HawtJNI Library class wrote native libraries to a predictable file name
in /tmp/ when the native libraries were bundled in a JAR file, and no
custom library path was specified. A local attacker could overwrite these
native libraries with malicious versions during the window between when
HawtJNI writes them and when they are executed. (CVE-2013-2035)

In Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, when running under a
security manager, it was possible for deployed code to get access to the
Modular Service Container (MSC) service registry without any permission
checks. This could allow malicious deployments to modify the internal state
of the server in various ways. (CVE-2014-0018)

It was found that the security audit functionality logged request
parameters in plain text. This may have caused passwords to be included in
the audit log files when using BASIC or FORM-based authentication. A local
attacker with access to audit log files could possibly use this flaw to
obtain application or server authentication credentials. (CVE-2014-0058)

The CVE-2013-6440 issue was discovered by David Illsley, Ron Gutierrez of
Gotham Digital Science, and David Jorm of Red Hat Product Security; the
CVE-2014-0093 issue was discovered by Josef Cacek of the Red Hat JBoss EAP
Quality Engineering team; the CVE-2013-2035 issue was discovered by Florian
Weimer of Red Hat Product Security; and the CVE-2014-0018 issue was
discovered by Stuart Douglas of Red Hat.

All users of Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.0.3 as provided from the Red Hat
Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.0.3.

3. Solution:

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying the update, back up your
existing installation, including all applications, configuration files,
databases and database settings, and so on.

It is recommended to halt the server by stopping the JBoss Application
Server process before installing this update, and then after installing
the update, restart the server by starting the JBoss Application Server
process.
