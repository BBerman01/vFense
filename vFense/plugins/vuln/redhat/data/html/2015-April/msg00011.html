                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Important: openstack-packstack and openstack-puppet-modules security and bug fix update
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2015:0789-01
Product:           Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform
Advisory URL:      <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-0789.html">https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-0789.html</a>
Issue date:        2015-04-07
CVE Names:         CVE-2015-1842 
=====================================================================

1. Summary:

Updated openstack-packstack and openstack-puppet-modules packages that fix
one security issue and several bugs are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0 for RHEL 7 - noarch

3. Description:

PackStack is a command-line utility for deploying OpenStack on existing
servers over an SSH connection. Deployment options are provided either
interactively, using the command line, or non-interactively by means of a
text file containing a set of preconfigured values for OpenStack
parameters. PackStack is suitable for proof-of-concept installations.
PackStack is suitable for deploying proof-of-concept installations.

It was discovered that the puppet manifests, as provided with the
openstack-puppet-modules package, would configure the pcsd daemon with a
known default password. If this password was not changed and an attacker
was able to gain access to pcsd, they could potentially run shell commands
as root. (CVE-2015-1842)

This issue was discovered by Alessandro Vozza of Red Hat.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* If OpenStack Networking is enabled, Packstack would display a warning if
the Network Manager service is active on hosts. (BZ#1117277)

* A quiet dependency on a newer version of selinux-policy causes
openstack-selinux 0.6.23 to fail to install modules when paired with
selinux-policy packages from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.0 or 7.0.z.
This causes Identity and other OpenStack services to receive 'AVC' denials
and malfunction under some circumstances. The following workarounds allow
the OpenStack services to function correctly:

1) Leave openstack-selinux at 0.6.18-2.el7ost until you are ready to update
to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1. At that time, a 'yum update' will resolve
the issue.

2) Install the updated selinux-policy and selinux-policy-targeted packages
from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 (version selinux-policy-3.13.1-23.el7 or
later), then update openstack-selinux to version 0.6.23-1.el7ost.
(BZ#1195252)

* A typo in the code caused a Sahara option that uses OpenStack Networking
to be always false. Sahara now uses OpenStack Networking if the parameter
'CONFIG_NEUTRON_INSTALL is set to 'y'. (BZ#1199047)

* Prior to this update, users had to install the OpenStack Unified Client
separately after an installation of Packstack. Packstack now installs it by
default. (BZ#1199114)

* This enhancement updates Packstack to retain temporary directories when
running an installation in debug mode. This assists with troubleshooting
activities. As a result, temporary directories are not deleted when running
Packstack with the --debug command line option. (BZ#1199565)

* Prior to this update, some validators did not use 'validate_not_empty' to
ensure that certain parameters contained values. As a result, a number of
internal validations could not be properly handled, leading to the
possibility of unexpected errors. This update fixes validators to use
validate_not_empty when required, resulting in correct validation behavior
from validators. (BZ#11995889)

In addition to the above issues, this update also addresses bugs and
enhancements which can be found in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack
Platform Technical Notes, linked to in the References section.

All openstack-packstack and openstack-puppet-modules users are advised to
upgrade to these updated packages, which correct these issues.
