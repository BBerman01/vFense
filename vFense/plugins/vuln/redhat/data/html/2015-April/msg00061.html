                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Moderate: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.5.1 update
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2015:0888-01
Product:           Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Advisory URL:      <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-0888.html">https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-0888.html</a>
Issue date:        2015-04-28
CVE Names:         CVE-2015-0237 CVE-2015-0257 
=====================================================================

1. Summary:

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.5.1 is now available.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

RHEV-M 3.5 - noarch

3. Description:

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is a visual tool for centrally
managing collections of virtual servers running Red Hat Enterprise Linux
and Microsoft Windows. This package also includes the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Manager API, a set of scriptable commands that give
administrators the ability to perform queries and operations on Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

The Manager is a JBoss Application Server application that provides several
interfaces through which the virtual environment can be accessed and
interacted with, including an Administration Portal, a User Portal, and a
Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface
(API).

It was discovered that the permissions to allow or deny snapshot creation
were ignored during live storage migration of a VM's disk between storage
domains. An attacker able to live migrate a disk between storage domains
could use this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0237)

It was discovered that a directory shared between the ovirt-engine-dwhd
service and a plug-in used during the service's startup had incorrect
permissions. A local user could use this flaw to access files in this
directory, which could potentially contain sensitive information. 
(CVE-2015-0257)

The CVE-2015-0237 issue was discovered by Red Hat Enterprise Visualization
Engineering, and the CVE-2015-0257 issue was discovered by Yedidyah Bar
David of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization team.

These updated Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager packages also
include numerous bug fixes and various enhancements. Space precludes
documenting all of these changes in this advisory. Users are directed to
the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.5 Technical Notes, linked to in the
References, for information on the most significant of these changes.

All Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager users are advised to upgrade
to these updated packages, which resolve these issues and add these
enhancements.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.
