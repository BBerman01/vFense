=====================================================================
                   Red Hat Security Advisory

Synopsis:          Moderate: openstack-neutron security, bug fix, and enhancement update
Advisory ID:       RHSA-2014:1119-01
Product:           Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform
Advisory URL:      <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1119.html">https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1119.html</a>
Issue date:        2014-09-02
CVE Names:         CVE-2014-3555 
=====================================================================

1. Summary:

Updated openstack-neutron packages that fix one security issue, several
bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

OpenStack 5.0 for RHEL 7 - noarch

3. Description:

OpenStack Networking (neutron) is a pluggable, scalable, and API-driven
system that provisions networking services to virtual machines. Its main
function is to manage connectivity to and from virtual machines. As of Red
Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0, 'neutron' replaces 'quantum'
as the core component of OpenStack Networking.

A denial of service flaw was found in neutron's handling of allowed address
pairs. As there was no enforced quota on the amount of allowed address
pairs, a sufficiently authorized user could possibly create a large number
of firewall rules, impacting performance or potentially rendering a compute
node unusable. (CVE-2014-3555)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Liping Mao from Cisco as the original reporter.

The openstack-neutron packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2014.1.2, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
previous version, most notable of which are:

* Multiple Open vSwitch agent fixes: the agent now sets bridges in the
correct order to avoid breaking tunnel networks, creates the integration
bridge if it is missing, sets the secure-failing mode for integration
bridges to ensure the 'openvswitch' service does not program NORMAL action
on restart and instead relies on L2 agent to manage those bridges on
restart, limits veth names to 15 characters, and no longer spawns RPC
consumers before all the needed data structures are ready to be accessed.

* RPC interactions between the DHCP agent and the Neutron plug-in have
been optimized.

* Rule updates for security groups are now applied more effectively.

* Firewall-as-a-Service (FWaaS): a possible race condition when deleting a
firewall has been fixed; iptables updates are no longer deferred for the
service.

* Metering: metering data for egress and ingress are now reported
separately; incorrect router key used to report against MongoDB has
been fixed.

* Load-Balancing-as-a-Service (LBaaS): resources are now registered against
quotas engine; rootwrap filters are now shipped independent of L3 agent
filters.

* Metaplugin now supports multiple RPC workers.

* The following plug-ins have been updated: BigSwitch, Brocade, Cisco N1k,
HyperV, OFAgent, PLUMgrid, and VMWare NSX.

information on the changes included in the 2014.1.2 of openstack-neutron.
(BZ#1127439)

This update also fixes the following bug:

* Previously, OpenStack Networking could stop processing network ports that
disappeared from the integration bridge during the L2-agent loop, even
after those ports were back on the bridge. As a result, updates for
temporarily disappeared ports were not handled by the L2 agent. With this
update, these ports are no longer marked as processed if not found on the
integration bridge. Ports are now processed correctly even after they
temporarily disappear from the integration bridge. (BZ#1115588)

All openstack-neutron users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues and add these enhancements.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.
